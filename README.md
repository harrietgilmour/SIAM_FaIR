# SIAM_FaIR
This repository holds code for my MSc dissertation project; coupling ecological economics with climate. 
**Project title:** Coupling Ecological Economics with Climate: A framework of climate scenarios to understand the need for urgent prioritisation of sustainable well-being 
**Project description:** This framework converts the Simple Integrated Assessment Model (SIAM) from its native Excel format to Python code. There is now a fully functioning version of SIAM that allows a variety of socio-economic scenarios to be created. Output from SIAM is directly placed into the Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model to generate a temperature projection for each scenario.
