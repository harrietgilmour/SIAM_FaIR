*This repository holds code for my MSc dissertation project; coupling ecological economics with climate.* <br />
**Project title:** Coupling Ecological Economics with Climate: A framework of climate scenarios to understand the need for urgent prioritisation of sustainable well-being <br />
**Project description:** This framework converts the Simple Integrated Assessment Model (SIAM) [documentation](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/bsaajj/SIAM%20PART%20I%20v2022.pdf) from its native Excel format to Python code. There is now a fully functioning version of SIAM that allows a variety of socio-economic scenarios to be created. Output from SIAM is directly placed into the Finite Amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) model [website](http://homepages.see.leeds.ac.uk/~mencsm/fair.htm) to generate a temperature projection for each scenario. <br />
**File notes:** M1 refers to method 1 and M2 refers to method 2. These are the two methods used to introduce non-CO2 emissions to the scenarios. Method 1 takes the whole range of RCP non-CO2 emissions to project the likely range of warming associated with each scenario. Method 2 uses a combintaion of RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 depending on whether the scenario is under decarbonisation or not.
